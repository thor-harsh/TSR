This project implements traffic sign recognition using advanced deep learning models, including CNN, ResNet50, Faster R-CNN, and YOLO. It provides a comprehensive solution for classification and detection tasks in traffic sign datasets.

## Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for grayscale conversion and histogram equalization.
- Support for multiple architectures:
  - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
  - **ResNet50**
  - **YOLOv5** for object detection
  - **Faster R-CNN** for object detection
- Model evaluation with metrics visualization.

## Dataset
The project uses a custom dataset located in the `Dataset` directory. Ensure the dataset is organized with one folder per class, where each folder contains images for that class.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-recognition.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download pre-trained weights for YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN and place them in the appropriate directories.

## Usage
### Training and Evaluation
Run the main script to train and evaluate models:
```bash
python main.py
```
### Supported Models
- **CNN**: A custom convolutional network for traffic sign classification.
- **ResNet50**: A transfer learning approach using a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
- **YOLOv5**: Real-time object detection.
- **Faster R-CNN**: High-accuracy object detection.
